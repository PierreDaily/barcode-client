# barcode-client

## Introduction

This app aim to provide a simple solution to track and compare groceries items prices overtime.
People will be able to scan a product barcode and quickly compare the price with other supermarket.
It's still in an early stage of development, right now I am focusing on the first feature :
User being able to add a new item (barcode, desciption, photo, etc.) to the database.

## Technical Details

The front-end is built using React Native and the UI graphic library React Native Paper.
The back-end is based on NodeJs, Express JS and SQLite.
I use Adobe XD to build mockup/proptype the graphical interface.
Right now i am the only developper working on this project so i didn't implement git-flow yet but a CI is running test on github everytime a pullrequest is made.
